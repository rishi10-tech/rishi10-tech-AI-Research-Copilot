# rishi10-tech-AI-Research-Copilot
 The project is an AI Research Copilot that helps users understand complex documents such as research papers, technical notes, and academic PDFs. It uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer user queries strictly based on the uploaded documents, ensuring accurate and context-aware responses. The system also explains mathematical equations
 it can also generates code for the equations which are being used in the paper and give the code in cpp,java,c,python.
